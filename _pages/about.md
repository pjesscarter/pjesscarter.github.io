Perry Carter is a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Politics at Princeton University. His research concentrates on the intersection of international and domestic politics, drawing on with a particular focus on the role played by transnational group identities in post-imperial contexts. His dissertation examines the consequences of territorial loss for the structure of domestic politics, using a mixed-methods approach based on a combination of formal decision modelling, survey and laboratory experiments, geographical causal identification, and field and archival work in Georgia and the Caucasus to establish links between individual behavior and system-level outcomes. Other ongoing projects explore the role of social structure in determining the incentives politicians face to subvert formal election rules through vote-buying and patronage, and the relationship between economic vulnerability and group identification in political cognition.

Previously, Perry worked as a professional bassoonist and classical saxophonist, performing solo and with orchestras and ensembles throughout New Zealand, including the [New Zealand Symphony Orchestra](https://www.nzso.co.nz/), [Christchurch Symphony Orchestra](https://cso.co.nz/), and [Dunedin Symphony Orchestra](https://dso.org.nz/).
