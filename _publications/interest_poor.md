excerpt: Clientelism, that is, the distribution of excludable benefits to citizens contingent on their political support, is associated with a host of negative economic and social outcomes. In addition to undermining the democratic process, clientelism has been linked with reduced trust, corruption and weakened public service delivery. Building on a formal model of clientelist transfers on a network, we study the effect of social networks on the prevalence and effectiveness of vote-buying. By combining complete local census data with aggregated data for small villages in Punjab, Pakistan, we estimate the effects of social network structure on identity politics and redistribution at the local level.
