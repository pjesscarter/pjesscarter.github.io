title: "Who is Responsible? A Model for Inference over Narrative Structure in Political Speech"

permalink: /publication/2024-narrative-networks
excerpt: The construction of narratives that situate basic facts in interpretable relations is one of the core functions of political speech, yet measurement difficulties have hampered systematic research in political science. Despite an explosion of interest in automatic text analysis, bag of words assumptions discard important relational information, while LLMs suffer from a lack of interpretability and reproducibility. In this paper, I introduce a random network model of political narratives based on a representation of text as subject-verb-object (SVO) interactions. I validate the model's ability to uncover novel aspects of political speech across multiple languages using two applications: partisanship in US congressional speeches and an event study of a censorship episode in Russia.
