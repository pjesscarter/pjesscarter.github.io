excerpt: We propose a model of electoral competition where candidates offer excludable
transfers to voters connected on a social network. We derive concentration results
for weighted graphs to compare large societies, with social structure represented by
asymptotic properties. We find that the diversion of public resources towards private
provision generically favors the majority group and is least prevalent when groups are
equipopulous and segregated. If candidates have heterogeneous information about
the electorate, information can overcome the tyranny of the majority when groups
are segregated or, given weak peer effects or an overall poor quality of information,
candidate office motivations are low.
