excerpt: Social structure matters for vote buying, yet most analyses do not account for interdependence between actors. We provide a formal model of elections in which candidates may offer private transfers to policy-motivated voters connected on a social network at the expense of a public good. Investigation of deep parameters governing social structure allows for comparison across societies. Contrary to much existing theory, equilibrium transfers are not determined by network density, but primarily by group fractionalization and homophily, while inequalities are driven by a disproportionate targeting of minorities. Additionally, we consider heterogeneous information between candidates, clarifying the role of density and demonstrating that homophily can endogenously generate in-group favoritism. Finally, we explore the role of network-dependent information flows with model simulations.
