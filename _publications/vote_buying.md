excerpt: Social networks play an important role in distributive politics, yet social structure is rarely considered explicitly. We provide a formal model of elections in which candidates may offer excludable transfers to policy-motivated voters connected on a social network. By transparently incorporating group shares, homophily, and density of ties in a generative framework, our model facilitates systematic comparison across societies that vary on these underlying dimensions. In equilibrium, transfers are determined primarily by group shares and homophily, with density mattering only indirectly. Inequalities in provision of goods are driven by disproportionate targeting of minorities. Additionally, we consider heterogeneous information between candidates, clarifying the main role of density as a source of more precise information and demonstrating that homophily can endogenously produce in-group favoritism even when candidates are purely office-motivated. These results highlight the importance of aggregate social structure on targeted redistribution and suggest new directions for empirical studies of non-programmatic distribution.
